### :bookmark: introduction

In this GitHub repository, we present a novel approach to solving the multi-dimensional multiple knapsack problem. This work stems from my master's thesis focused on resource management in cloud computing. To investigate and test my thesis, I initially conducted experiments using a simplified environment, prior to considering the complexities inherent in cloud computing resource management. The primary objective of our project is to train a transformer model using reinforcement learning algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We have implemented two variants of PPO for this purpose.
